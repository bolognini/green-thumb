<p align="center">&laquo;<b>Green Thumb is an app built to help you find a new green friend</b>&raquo;</p>

This project was part of the Red Ventures frontend test. The challenge consists in building an application that consumes an API by filtering some plant preferences, like the amount of sunlight and watering the plant needs and if it is toxic or not for animals. When the result is filtered, the application offers a form for buying the chosen green friend. It validates user name and email, then sends it to the backend API.

There wasn't tooling limitations, so it was built with React, following functional componentization approach, and Styled-Components was used for styling.

You can access the live application on the following link: http://greenthumb.netlify.app/

The layout was designed by Red Ventures and provided for the development. The provided Sketch file was used on Figma for checking spacing, size, fonts and colors specifications. Some icons and illustrations were exported from Figma as well.
